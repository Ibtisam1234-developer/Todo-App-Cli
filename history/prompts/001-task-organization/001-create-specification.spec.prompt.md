## Prompt

Target: Intermediate Todo CLI (Organization & Usability)
Features:
1. Schema Enhancement: Update 'tasks' table in Neon to include:
   - priority (TEXT: low, medium, high)
   - category (TEXT: e.g., work, personal)
   - created_at/due_date (TIMESTAMP)
2. Priorities & Tags: Allow users to assign a priority and a category during 'add' and 'update'.
3. Search & Filter:
   - Command `search <keyword>` to find tasks by title/description.
   - Command `list` with flags: `--priority`, `--category`, and `--status`.
4. Sorting: Add a `--sort` flag to `list` command (options: date, priority, alpha).
5. UI: Use 'Rich' to display tasks in a color-coded table where high priority is Red and low is Green.

## Response snapshot

Specification successfully created for feature **001-task-organization** with comprehensive user stories, requirements, and success criteria.

**User Stories (4, prioritized P1-P2)**:

**P1 - Enhanced Task Creation**:
- Add tasks with priority (low/medium/high), category, and due dates
- Default priority: medium, other fields optional
- Validation: Invalid priority values rejected with clear error messages

**P1 - Task Filtering & Search**:
- Filter list by `--priority`, `--category`, `--status` flags
- Search command matching keyword against title and description
- Composable filters (can combine multiple criteria)
- Clear message when no results found

**P2 - Task Sorting**:
- Sort by priority (high竊知edium竊値ow), date (chronological), or alpha (alphabetical)
- Sort combines with filters
- Tasks without due dates handled appropriately

**P2 - Rich UI with Color Coding**:
- Rich library table display
- High priority: Red, Medium: Yellow, Low: Green
- Clean table with all attributes visible

**Functional Requirements (21 items)**:
- FR-001 to FR-004: Schema fields (priority, category, created_at, due_date)
- FR-005 to FR-007: Task creation/update with new fields
- FR-008 to FR-011: Filtering and search commands
- FR-012 to FR-015: Search matching and sort behavior
- FR-016 to FR-019: Rich UI with color coding
- FR-020 to FR-021: Composable filters and empty results handling

**Success Criteria (6 measurable outcomes)**:
- Create tasks with all attributes in under 30 seconds
- Filtered lists display within 1 second
- Search returns results in under 1 second
- 100% color-coded priority display
- Locate tasks in under 5 seconds
- Single view of all task attributes

**Quality Validation**: All checklist items passed - spec is technology-agnostic, testable, and ready for planning.

## Outcome

- 笨 Impact: Created comprehensive specification for task organization features including filtering, search, sorting, and Rich UI
- 洫ｪ Tests: N/A (specification phase)
- 沒 Files: Created `specs/001-task-organization/spec.md` and `specs/001-task-organization/checklists/requirements.md`
- 沐 Next prompts: `/sp.plan` to create implementation plan, or `/sp.clarify` if additional questions arise
- 洫 Reflection: Specification clearly defines user value, avoids implementation details, and includes measurable success criteria. All validation checks passed without needing clarifications.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Manual validation PASS (all items checked)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Monitor whether priority sort order (high竊知edium竊値ow) meets user expectations in practice

# Specification Quality Checklist: Interactive Todo Application

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-17
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All checklist items pass. The specification is ready for `/sp.plan`.

**Validation Summary**:
- ✅ Specification contains no technology-specific details
- ✅ All 15 functional requirements are testable
- ✅ 7 success criteria are measurable and user-focused
- ✅ 4 user stories cover complete CRUD functionality with clear priorities
- ✅ 6 edge cases identified for error handling validation
- ✅ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
- ✅ All sections complete with concrete details

The specification successfully maintains separation of concerns by describing WHAT the application does without specifying HOW it will be implemented, aligning with the agent-oriented architecture defined in the constitution.

# Specification Quality Checklist: Advanced Todo CLI - Recurring Tasks & Smart Features

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-31
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: PASSED - All checklist items complete

**Notes**:
- Specification successfully captures all 4 features requested by user
- User stories are prioritized (P1-P4) and independently testable
- Edge cases cover common scenarios (time zones, ambiguous dates, leap years)
- Functional requirements are specific and testable
- Success criteria are measurable, technology-agnostic, and user-focused
- Assumptions document reasonable defaults for unspecified details
- No clarification needed - all reasonable defaults provided based on industry standards
